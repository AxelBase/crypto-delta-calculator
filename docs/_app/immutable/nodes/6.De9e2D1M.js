Direct quantity comparisons would be inaccurate due to varying prices, so the tool uses live USD equivalents for fair assessment.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">When users select the same cryptocurrency for both inputs, the calculation is straightforward: the standard percentage formula applies directly to the coin amounts. However, when different coins are chosen—such as switching from Bitcoin to Ethereum—the application automatically converts both amounts to USD using current CoinGecko prices before calculating the delta.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">This normalization ensures the result reflects true value change rather than arbitrary quantity differences. For instance, moving from 0.001 BTC to 0.5 ETH uses their respective USD values at the moment of calculation, providing an apples-to-apples comparison.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">The new cryptocurrency dropdown defaults to the same as the old selection for convenience, but users can override it to enable cross-crypto mode. Immediate USD previews below each input help verify the converted values before submission.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">The derived percentage uses the formula: ((new USD value - old USD value) / old USD value) * 100. Results display with two decimal places, positive or negative signs, and a warning alert for drops exceeding 50 percent to highlight potentially erroneous inputs.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">This approach works seamlessly with fluctuating markets. As prices change between refreshes, subsequent calculations incorporate the latest rates, keeping deltas relevant to current conditions.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Edge cases are handled robustly: zero old USD values trigger clear errors, non-numeric inputs are caught early, and API failures fall back to manual calculation modes where possible.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Users benefit from this feature when rebalancing portfolios, evaluating trades, or simply exploring hypothetical shifts between assets. It removes the mental math of manual conversions, delivering instant, accurate insights.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">The client-side reactivity ensures updates happen instantaneously as inputs change, with no page reloads required.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Advantages of USD Normalization</h2> <ul class="svelte-1al8b51"><li class="svelte-1al8b51">Accurate value-based percentage changes</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">Supports any combination from top 10 cryptos</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">Real-time pricing integration</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">Clear visual feedback and warnings</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">Copy button for easy result sharing</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">Why not calculate directly on coin amounts?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Different coins have vastly different prices; direct comparison would distort the true percentage change in value.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">Can I compare more than two cryptos?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">The core calculator handles two at a time; the live table provides broader multi-coin views.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">What if prices change during input?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Calculation uses prices at the moment of submission for consistency.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1al8b51">This cross-crypto capability makes the tool uniquely versatile for multi-asset analysis.</p></article></div>');function q(u){var e=D();y("1al8b51",m=>{var s=C(),v=d(f(s),6);a(4),r(()=>i(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),g(()=>{b.title="Calculating Percentage Changes Across Different Cryptos | Crypto Delta Blog"}),l(m,s)});var t=o(e),h=o(t);a(4),n(t),a(2),n(e),r(()=>i(h,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),l(u,e)}export{q as component,k as universal};
